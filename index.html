        <p><strong># DrillSki</strong>
An open database of snow ski binding templates, with tools to create pdf templates and output gcode for direct cnc drill. Enter your boot sole length and the binding model and out pops the info you need ready to go mount your bindings.</p>

<p>I mount a fair number of ski bindings every winter. Its time consuming boring but needs a great attention to detail and either expensive drilling jigs or paper templates are the only option. But I have a CNC and its a lot more accurate than any template.</p>

<p>So the plan is to document the database that is out there so far. How that is captured in terms of hole geometry and distances apart is up for discussion here in this forum. Ideally we enter the data so it can then be easily translated to a drawing format like pdf and also exported straight to gcode.</p>

<p>We need to collect info such as.......
    *Binding model and year
    *Size small/med/large if applicable
    *Toe and heel screw locations in x / y format in mm referenced to the middle line of the ski as zero and the middle line accross the *heel/toe piece as zero - does that make sense?
    *Length and diameter of screw holes 
    *Torque settings if applicable
    *Please add to this list.....</p>

<p>Then the process of taking this data and turning it into a PDF or gcode or other formats such as DXF, so its useful..... feel free to start suggesting how this is done.</p>

<p>This could be a great enabler for a small or large ski shop with a very basic 3 axis cnc. It could be used with open source cnc software like GRBL on Arduino based CNC controller to make a fast and reliable workshop router that quickly selected the model and BSL</p>
