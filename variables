Define a binding drilling pattern
  *Shall we stick to mm since thats what most ski boots and bindings (probably all actually) are measured in
  *The ski is oriented standing up on its tail face up
  *Points in x are relative to the length centre line of the ski end to end
  *Points in y, are relative to the exact front of the boot sole, so we can start making a relativity to boot sole length BSL.
  *toex
  *toey
  *toey0 is the exact front of the boot sole
  *toez
  *heelx
  *heely
  *heelz
  *BSL is the zero point for all output co-ordinates in the y
  *centrescrew (eg Marker Duke)
  *screw diameter(s)
  *screw length(s)
  *From a zero point , negative values are to the left, positive values are to the right, logically.....
