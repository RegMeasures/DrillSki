Define a binding drilling pattern
Shall we stick to mm since thats what most ski boots and bindings (probably all actually) are measured in
toex
toey
toez
heelx
heely
heelz
centrescrew (eg Marker Duke)
Points in x are relative to the length centre line of the ski end to end
Points in toey, are relative to the exact front of the boot sole, so we can start making a relativity to boot sole length BSL. toey0 is the exact front of the boot sole
screw diameter(s)
screw length(s)
