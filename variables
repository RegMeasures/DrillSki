Define a binding drilling pattern
  *We use metric mm since thats what most ski boots and bindings (probably all actually) are measured in
  *The ski is oriented standing vertically on its tail longways in the Y axis
  *Points in x are relative - or + to the end to end centre line of the ski
  *Points in y are relative - or + to the ski boot sole centre line so we can start making a relativity to boot sole length BSL.
  Points in z are hole depth , Z zero is the top sheet, -z is the depth eg. -z9.0 is a 9mm deep hole below topsheet level
  *toe piece co-ordinates defined clockwise starting from front left screw eg. x-50y-20,x-30y-20 ............ following in order of the csv seperated values any non used values are just consecutive double commas then.....
  *centrescrew (eg Marker Duke) can be another toe reference
  *heel piece co-ordinates defined clockwise starting from front left screw eg. x-50y-20,x-30y-20 ............ following in order of the csv seperated values any non used values are just consecutive double commas then.....
   *screw diameter(s) defined by SD
  *screw length(s) defined by SL
  *From a zero point x0y0 origin, negative values are to the left or down, positive values are to the right or up, logically.....

Using the templates from Knut Pohl, they reference x and y values for drilling holes whose origin can be traced back to the BSL ski center zero line and ski mid line. So this should make it easy to do in a spreadsheet for a start to generate co-ordinates for X and Y to be then converted to gcode. However the best way is to take that BSL and binding xy drilling data and build a simple app that generates the gcode / pdf / dxf directly
